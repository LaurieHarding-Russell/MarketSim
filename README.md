# Market Simulator.
This is just meant to be a fun project to help me understand the stockmarket better. It shouldn't be taken seriously. 

This is by no means an accurate representation of real life.

## Getting started
1. Start up the program by running `bazel run Market`.
2. To start/reset preform a get on `127.0.0.1/start` (Yup, I was too lazy to make a UI)
3. Start up trading bots.
4. To simulate a year preform a get on `127.0.0.1/simulate-year`


## Bots
To start the example bot run `bazel run //TradingBot:exampleBot`.
