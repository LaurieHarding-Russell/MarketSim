## Creating a trading bot

### Creating a trading bot (using bazel).
The market sim exports a swagger controller.yaml.


The easiest way to creat a new bot is to copy the WORKSPACE file and BUILD file in this folder.




### API
See the swagger.yaml file for the api.
To view a swagger.yaml see https://editor.swagger.io/
Many ide's have a swagger viewer

### Do not use calls not included in the swagger. Reseting the world and such is cheating ;)
